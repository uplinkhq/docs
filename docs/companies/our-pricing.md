# Our pricing

It's free for you to post a job in our community. When you find a freelancer and start working together, she will pay us a percentage of her earnings for a limited time as commission.

The advantage of our approach is that you don't have to sign a contract with us and that you won't receive any separate invoice from us. The freelancers pay a fee to us, when they find a new client via Uplink.
