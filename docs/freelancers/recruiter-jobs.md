# Recruiter-Jobs

Recruiter jobs are not posted by the Uplink team, but by one of our Recruiting Partners. If you apply to a recruiter job, they are the ones who will interview you and introduce you to the end customer. If you and the end customer decide to work together, you will make a contract with the Recruiting Partner and your invoices will be issued to them as well.

For recruiter jobs, we charge you a [fee of 3% for the first 6 months of working with the end customer.](our-fee.md)
