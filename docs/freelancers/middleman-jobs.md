# Middleman jobs

Middleman jobs are not posted by the Uplink team, but by one of our [Recruiting Partners](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/middleman-jobs#recruiting-partners). If you apply to such a job, they will be the ones to determine whether you are a good match and introduce you to the end customer.

For middleman jobs, we don't charge you [our commission](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/our-commission)! 100% of the rate you enter when you apply to the job will end up in your pocket. The middleman will, of course, charge the end customer a higher rate than the one they pay you.

## Recruiting Partners

We hand-pick our Recruiting Partners to make sure their approach to recruiting mirrors our own!

### Nemensis

Nemensis is our first Recruiting Partner and we started working with them on September 15, 2020. The Nemensis team consists of [Benjamin Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwalk3r/) and [Ren√© Schwinning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-schwinning-a369b4bb/), who have been building the freelancing arm of the Nemensis AG since early 2020.
