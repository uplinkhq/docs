# Our Slack workspace

[Back in November 2017, we decided to create a Slack workspace for all our members](https://medium.com/uplink-it-freelancer-network/lets-move-to-slack-86558368e6d8) and use it as our primary communication channel for job postings, meetup invitations, public announcements, and everything else that we wanted to relay to our members. This has turned out to be a good decision, because the fantastic [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) has allowed us to automate many things, including most of the job application process.

## Public channels

The following public channels are open for all members:

* **\#announcements** - Official announcements from the Uplink team. Only admins can post in this channel, but everyone can \(and is encouraged to\) comment in a thread on the announcements!
* **\#business** - Letâ€™s talk about taxes, finances, insurance, freelancer registration and company incorporation! Feel free to ask for help if youâ€™re new to the game!
* **\#events** - Are you planning to attend a meetup or conference soon? Let the other Uplink members know! Upcoming Uplink meetups and events will also be posted here.
* **\#ideas** - Do you have an idea for a new project/service/business? Share it here to get feedback!
* **\#investing** - Chat about where to be invest your hard-earned money, be it in stocks, bonds, ETF, crypto etc.
* **\#uplink** - If youâ€™re interested to hear what the Uplink team is working on and give feedback on ideas for new features, join this channel!
* **\#lounge** - Fun stuff, discussions about life and the universe, screenshots of the most absurd recruiter requests, and everything else non-business related.
* **\#tech-backend -** Letâ€™s talk about backend development! Languages, frameworks, concepts etc.
* **\#tech-blockchain -** Letâ€™s talk about Blockchain development! BTC, ETH, Solidity etc.

* **\#tech-mobile -** Letâ€™s talk about mobile development! Android, iOS, Hybrid, etc.
* **\#lang-rust -** Everything about the Rust language.
* **\#city-berlin -** Talk to other developers in Berlin about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc.
* **\#city-frankfurt -** Talk to other developers in Frankfurt about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc.
* **\#city-hamburg -** Talk to other developers in Hamburg about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc.
* **\#city-muenchen -** Talk to other developers in MÃ¼nchen about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc.
* **\#city-wien -** Talk to other developers in Wien about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc.

## Job channels

Once a new job is published, it is posted to one or \(most of the time\) multiple job channels, where all members can apply for it. As a member, you can simply join the channels you are interested in \(e.g., if you'd only like to hear about jobs with React.js or Java, join **\#jobs-direct-frontend-react** and **\#jobs-direct-backend-java**\) and you will receive a mobile or desktop notification from Slack when a new job ist posted.

**\#jobs-direct** is the main channel where all new jobs are posted to. If you really would like to be notified of every new job, no matter where the client is located or which skills are required, join this channel!

### Jobs by location

If you're only interested in jobs in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, or MÃ¼nchen, or full-remote jobs, join one of these channels:

* **\#jobs-direct-berlin** - Jobs in Berlin
* **\#jobs-direct-hamburg** - Jobs in Hamburg
* **\#jobs-direct-frankfurt** - Jobs in Frankfurt
* **\#jobs-direct-muenchen** - Jobs in MÃ¼nchen
* **\#jobs-direct-remote** - Jobs that can be done completely remotely \(apart from possibly a kickoff meeting at the client's office\)

### Jobs by technologies/skills

If you're interested in jobs that have a requirement for a specific technology or skill, join one of these channels.

Note that the channels **\#jobs-direct-backend**, **\#jobs-direct-frontend**, and **\#jobs-direct-mobile** will receive all job postings from their sub-groups, i.e. every job posted to **\#jobs-direct-backend-ruby** will also be posted to **\#jobs-direct-backend**.

* **\#jobs-direct-cms** - Jobs with a focus on CMS \(WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, TYPO3, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-direct-devops** - Jobs with a focus on DevOps \(Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-direct-ecommerce -** Jobs with a focus on e-commerce \(Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-direct-pm-agile** - Jobs for PMs, Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches etc.
* **\#jobs-direct-ui-ux** - Jobs with a focus on UI/UX design
* **\#jobs-direct-backend** - Jobs with a focus on backend development
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-cpp**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-dotnet**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-go**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-java**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-node**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-php**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-python**
* **\#jobs-direct-backend-ruby**
* **\#jobs-direct-frontend**
* **\#jobs-direct-frontend-angular**
* **\#jobs-direct-frontend-react**
* **\#jobs-direct-frontend-vue**
* **\#jobs-direct-mobile**
* **\#jobs-direct-mobile-android**
* **\#jobs-direct-mobile-ios**
* **\#jobs-direct-mobile-hybrid**

### **Community jobs**

If you'd like to hear about jobs from other members of the Uplink community, join **\#jobs-community**!

Unlike the other job channels, **\#jobs-community** is open for everyone to post. Post your job here if:

* you have a personal project, but are missing the skills or time to work on it, or
* you're working on a client project that you could need some help with, or
* you started a startup and are looking for co-founders or a CTO.

If you post in this channel, please keep a few things in mind:

* Be prepared to pay a market rate for the skills you're looking for \(unless you're looking for a co-founder and offering shares\). As a rule of thumb, it shouldn't be much less than what you would accept yourself if you were offered the job.
* Describe the tasks as detailed as possible to make the job appealing.
* Mention whether you'd like to meet the other freelancer face-to-face or if they can work completely remotely. Of course, jobs that can be done 100% remotely are much more attractive.
* Mention how interested freelancers should contact you. The easiest is "PM me for details".
* Please don't use [@channel](https://slack.com/intl/de-de/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace) to notify all members in the channel of your post.

You should **not** post in this channel if you simply received a job offer from a client \(or recruiter\) that you don't want to take on. [Instead, you should refer the client to us!](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/referring-a-client) ðŸ˜‡

## Restrictions

Our Slack workspace has a few restrictions:

### 10k messages limit

We are on the free Slack plan and have no way to switch to any of the paid plans, since this would mean several thousand Euros per month in fees that we would have to pay to Slack.

On the free plan, only the last 10.000 messages are accessible in our workspace. This sounds like a lot, but depending on how active our members are and how many jobs are posted \(and applied to\), it means only the last 1-2 months' messages are visible.

To avoid all the knowledge, that is shared by our members, ending up in the void, we introduced the [Community Wiki](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/community-wiki) in June 2020.

### No email notifications after a period of inactivity

Slack wants to make sure that users do not receive email notifications from workspaces that they don't regularly visit.

To that end, users are tagged as 'inactive' if they show no \(or only very little\) activity in a workspace for 14 days. If another 60 days go by without activity, Slack stops sending the user email notifications for this workspace.

The way that Slack defines 'showing activity' is very specific - sending at least 10 messages in a 7 day period, or at least 9 actions on 3 days within a 7 day period. An action could be reading a message in a channel, changing the channel, or creating a post.

So if you don't receive any email notifications from our workspace anymore, most likely Slack has tagged you as 'inactive'. **This can happen even if you log in regularly, read messages, or even post messages yourself, since you might still end up under the 'showing activity' threshold explained before!**

**The easiest way to make sure that your account is set to 'active' and you're receiving email notifications is to** [**send 10 quick messages to yourself**](https://slack.com/help/articles/219899267-Save-notes-and-files-in-your-personal-DM)**. Yes, this actually works! \(confirmed by Slack support\)**
