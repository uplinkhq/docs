# Our Slack

Slack has become our central hub, where all our members hang out and chat, and all new jobs are published.

You can love or hate Slack, but for our community is has proven to be a fantastic hub, where all threads come together. All new Uplink members receive an invite to our Slack automatically and most choose to accept it, since this is where most of the action happens, i.e. discussions among members, announcements from the Uplink team, job postings and more.

**Moreover, we have implemented the complete job application process as a workflow in Slack, so if you plan to apply to a job, you better get on board!** ðŸ¤ 

You can find a number of **public channels** and **job channels** in our Slack. Read on to find out what each one is there for!

## Public channels

This is where you can talk with other Uplink members!

* **\#announcements** - Official announcements from the Uplink team. Only admins can post in this channel, but everyone can (and is encouraged to) comment in a thread on the announcements!
* **\#business** - Discussions about self-employment, projects, recruiters, taxes, insurance, etc. - everything that is related to the "business" of being an IT freelancer!
* **\#events** - Links to interesting meetups, events, and conferences where you can meet other Uplink members.
* **\#ideas** - Post your side projects or ideas for new services or products here to get feedback!
* **\#investing** - Talk about investments, banks, stocks, crypto, etc. with your fellow Uplinkers.
* **\#uplink** - If youâ€™re interested to hear what the Uplink team is working on and give feedback on ideas for new features, join this channel!
* **\#lounge** - Fun stuff, discussions about life and the universe, screenshots of the most absurd recruiter messages, and everything else non-business related.
* **\#lang-rust -** Everything about the Rust programming language.
* **\#tech-backend, \#tech-frontend** + 5 more - Channels starting with "tech-" are dedicated to questions, discussions, news, and articles about a certain tech topic.
* **\#city-berlin, \#city-hamburg** + 3 more - Channels starting with "city-" are dedicated to questions and discussions about the local IT scene, events, coworking spaces, companies etc. in a certain city.

### Guidelines

Here are a few articles with guidelines for effective online conversations that we recommend everyone to skim:

## Job channels

Each time a new job is published, it is posted to one or (most of the time) multiple job channels, where all members can apply to it. As a member, you can simply join the channels you are interested in (e.g., if you'd only like to hear about direct jobs with React.js or Java, join **\#jobs-direct-frontend-react** and **\#jobs-direct-backend-java**) and you will receive a mobile or desktop notification from Slack each time a new job ist posted.

[**Direct jobs**](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/direct-jobs) **and** [**recruiter jobs**](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/recruiter-jobs) **are posted to separate channels. Join the ones that are relevant to you!**

### **All jobs**

* **\#jobs-direct** - All direct jobs
* **\#jobs-recruiter** - All recruiter jobs

### Direct jobs by location

If you're only interested in direct jobs in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, or MÃ¼nchen, or full-remote jobs, join one of these channels:

* **\#jobs-direct-frankfurt** - Jobs in Frankfurt

If you're interested in direct jobs in a specific skill area, join one of these channels.

Note that the channels **\#jobs-direct-backend**, **\#jobs-direct-frontend**, and **\#jobs-direct-mobile** will receive all job postings from their sub-groups, i.e. every job posted to **\#jobs-direct-backend-ruby** will also be posted to **\#jobs-direct-backend**.

* **\#jobs-recruiter-frontent** - Recruiter frontend jobs
* **\#jobs-recruiter-backend** - Recruiter backend jobs (PHP, Java, .NET, etc.)
* **\#jobs-recruiter-mobile** - Recruiter mobile jobs (Android, iOS, Hybrid, etc.)

### **Community jobs**

If you'd like to hear about jobs from other members of the Uplink community, join **\#jobs-community**!

Unlike the other job channels, **\#jobs-community** is open for everyone to post. Post your job here if:

* you have a personal project, but are missing the skills or time to work on it, or
* you're working on a client project that you could need some help with, or
* you started a startup and are looking for co-founders or a CTO.

If you post in this channel, please keep a few things in mind:

* Be prepared to pay a market rate for the skills you're looking for (unless you're looking for a co-founder and offering shares). As a rule of thumb, it shouldn't be much less than what you would accept yourself if you were offered the job.
* Describe the tasks as detailed as possible to make the job appealing.
* Mention whether you'd like to meet the other freelancer face-to-face or if they can work completely remotely. Of course, jobs that can be done 100% remotely are much more attractive.
* Mention how interested freelancers should contact you. The easiest is "PM me for details".
* Please don't use [@channel](https://slack.com/intl/de-de/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace) to notify all members in the channel of your post.

You should **not** post in this channel if you simply received a job offer from a client (or recruiter) that you don't want to take on. [Instead, you should refer the client to us!](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/referring-a-client) ðŸ˜‡

## Restrictions

Our Slack workspace has a few restrictions:

### 10k messages limit

We are on the free Slack plan and have no way to switch to any of the paid plans, since this would mean several thousand Euros per month in fees that we would have to pay to Slack.

On the free plan, only the last 10.000 messages are accessible in our workspace. This sounds like a lot, but depending on how active our members are and how many jobs are posted (and applied to), it means only the last 1-2 months' messages are visible.

To avoid all the knowledge, that is shared by our members, ending up in the void, we introduced the [Community Wiki](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/community-wiki) in June 2020.

### No email notifications after a period of inactivity

Slack wants to make sure that users do not receive email notifications from workspaces that they don't regularly visit.

To that end, users are tagged as 'inactive' if they show no (or only very little) activity in a workspace for 14 days. If another 60 days go by without activity, Slack stops sending the user email notifications for this workspace.

The way that Slack defines 'showing activity' is very specific - sending at least 10 messages in a 7 day period, or at least 9 actions on 3 days within a 7 day period. An action could be reading a message in a channel, changing the channel, or creating a post.

So if you don't receive any email notifications from our workspace anymore, most likely Slack has tagged you as 'inactive'. **This can happen even if you log in regularly, read messages, or even post messages yourself, since you might still end up under the 'showing activity' threshold explained before!**

**The easiest way to make sure that your account is set to 'active' and you're receiving email notifications is to** [**send 10 quick messages to yourself**](https://slack.com/help/articles/219899267-Save-notes-and-files-in-your-personal-DM)**. Yes, this actually works! (confirmed by Slack support)**
