# Direktjobs

Direct jobs are the ones we have been publishing since the beginning of (Uplink) time. We talk directly to the clients that are looking for a freelancer, publish the job, and select and introduce the candidates. The candidate that ends up getting the job will make a contract directly with the client, and the invoices will also be issued by the candidate to the client.

For direct jobs, we charge you a [fee of 10% for the first 6 months of working with the client.](our-fee.md)

## Our selection process

After publishing a new direct job, we usually try to ensure that it stays open for applications for at least 24 hours, so that all interested candidates have the opportunity to apply. Afterwards, we check the applications in terms of the candidates' expertise (skills and experience) and whether they fulfill the job’s general conditions (start date, availability, rate, etc.).

Usually, we try to introduce 2-3 suitable candidates for each job, unless the client is looking for several freelancers for the same job, in which case we might introduce more candidates. In cases where a lot of candidates apply to a job quickly after publishing, we may have to close a job before 24 hours have passed, or even reject candidates who could be a good match.

**If you are rejected for a job and are unsure why or would like to know more details, please don't hesitate to ask!** We will always try to give you as detailed feedback as possible. A rejection is never intended to be personal.

### How do we assess the candidate's expertise?

Ideally, the candidate should have completed several jobs with the required tech stack within the last two years. Moreover, experience in the client’s industry/segment (e-commerce, fashion, banking, etc.) or with similar clients (startups, corporates, agencies, etc.) is a plus.

### The importance of a convincing CV

Our assessment of a candidate’s expertise is based on a lot of factors: the job application, CV, online profiles (portfolio website, XING, LinkedIn, GitHub etc.), feedback from previous engagements via Uplink etc.

**Once we introduce a candidate to a client, though, the reality is that most of the time, it’s the CV that plays the biggest role in the client's decision whether to talk to the candidate or not.** For that reason, it’s really important that the CV accurately reflects the candidate’s current skills and experience, especially in regards to the client’s job.

From our experience, the most important aspects of a good CV are:

* **No obvious design flaws** - you don’t have to spend hours to design your CV, just pick a decent template and stick to it. The most important thing is that the formatting and spelling are correct and consistent.
* **Up-to-date** - all jobs of the last 5 years (if possible) should be included. If the last job ended 6 months ago, please mention what you did since then ("sabbatical", "parental leave", "learning the guitar", etc.).
* **Project list with task and skill summary** - include a short summary (2-3 sentences are enough) of the tasks you performed in each job and which skills/technologies you used.

If you prefer, you can move your project list to a separate document to keep your CV a one-pager.

**The importance of the project list cannot be overstated.** Whether we like it or not, clients (and recruiters) will often look at this list alone to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a job. If the job’s main skills are mentioned in the last 2 or 3 jobs of the candidate, it makes a very good impression. If not, a different candidate might be given priority for that reason alone.
