# Referring a client

Ever since Uplink started back in 2016, word-of-mouth has been our most important and effective ‘acquisition channel’ for new clients. Especially when one of our members recommends us to a company that they already work for or that has approached them, it has oftentimes lead to a very pleasant and trusting relationship.

**Naturally, we'd like to reward our members for introducing new clients to us. This is why we're offering a flat sum of 300€ (net) for each introduction that leads to the placement of a freelancer in the following six months.**

## **Why is it a flat sum instead of a percentage of the revenue the new client will bring in?**

One the one hand, [since our commission for a placement is paid over the course of 6 months](our-commission.md), the freelancer who referred the client would have to wait a long time to receive the reward. And on the other hand, if we managed to place a freelancer with the client but the project was cancelled early, our revenue and thus a percentages reward might be very low. For those reasons we decided to make the reward a flat sum.

## **Why do you limit the payout period to six months?**

You will receive the reward if we manage to place a freelancer with the new clients within 6 months after the introduction. The reason is that we are of course most interested in meeting clients who are actively looking for a freelancer right now, or in all likelihood very soon. In our experience, talking to clients who are not actively searching for freelancers rarely turns out to be a good investment of our time, or theirs.

## **What kind of clients are you looking for?**

The most important condition is that the client is currently (or most likely very soon) looking for a freelancer. A great example is a client who contacted you about a project, but you don’t have the time or desire to do it. Apart from that, it should simply be a client that you would consider working for yourself and one that has [a realistic budget for a freelancer in Germany](../companies/working-with-a-freelancer#how-much-does-a-freelancer-charge).

## **What if you already know the client?**

Of course it might be the case that we already know the client from another referral, that we have worked with them before, or even that they have contacted us regarding the same project. In that case, we will tell you about it immediately. You can rest assured that — when in doubt — we will always try to err on the fair side of paying you the reward rather than insisting that we’ve already heard of the the client or project before. If you want to check whether we know the client already before introducing them to us, simply send us a mail and describe them (or the project) and we will tell you if we know them.

## **When and how will I get the reward?**

We will automatically track when and by whom a new client was introduced and contact you via Slack or email as soon as we successfully place a freelancer with them. We will then ask you to issue an invoice to us for the referral reward.

## **How should I introduce the client?**

Simply send a mail to the client with us (hello@uplink.tech) in CC and tell them how we can help. If possible, mention a few details about the client and their project in the mail as well. We will then take over and schedule a first phone call with them.
