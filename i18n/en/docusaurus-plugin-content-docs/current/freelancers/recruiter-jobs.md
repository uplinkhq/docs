# Recruiter jobs

Unlike direct jobs, recruiter jobs are not posted by the Uplink team, but by one of our recruiting partners. These are selected recruiters and agencies that can independently post their jobs on our platform. They do not have direct access to the profiles of our members and cannot contact them directly, though.

[Our fee](our-fee.md) for recruiter jobs is 3% of what the freelancer invoices the recruiter, not 10% as for direct jobs.

When a member applies for a recruiter job and an interview with the recruiter is set up, the rest of the process is directly between the freelancer and the recruiter. The recruiter introduces the freelancer to the end customer and takes care of the further application and interview process. The contract is then also concluded directly between the freelancer and the recruiter.
