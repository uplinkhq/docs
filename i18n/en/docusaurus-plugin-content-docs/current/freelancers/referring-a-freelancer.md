# Referring a freelancer

The Uplink community grows primarily through the referrals of its members! We are very grateful for this and would like to show our appreciation to all members who recommend Uplink to their colleagues and friends.

**For this reason, at the beginning of each month, we raffle off a thank you gift among all members who have recommended someone in the past month!** The winner gets to choose between:

* 🍺 a craft beer package,
* 🤖 a gadget of their choice
* 🎽 or an Uplink t-shirt (coming soon).

We will contact the winner via Slack or email and also mention them (with their permission) in the Slack channel [#announcements](https://slack.com/app_redirect?team=T1LBG4C5N&channel=C1LBX0MGA).

## **Participate**

To participate, any member can refer Uplink to a colleague using their personal referral link found in the [member area](https://my.uplink.tech/)! All freelancers who apply to Uplink within 30 days of clicking on this link will be considered referred by the member.
