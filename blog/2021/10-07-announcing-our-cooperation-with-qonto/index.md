We are very excited to announce the brand new cooperation with [Qonto](https://qonto.com/), a startup that is also part of the [Factory Berlin](https://factoryberlin.com/) network!

<!--truncate-->

We noticed that there are regular discussions in Uplink community about topics like accounting solutions and choosing a suitable provider for a business account. So far, our partnerships have focused more on accounting than on business accounts. Qonto offers the latter tailored to the needs of freelancers combined with smart tools that make your accounting and tax filing work much more convenient. What we like most about Qonto is that their service can be easily connected to many 3rd party providers like Accountable or Sevdesk, two other cooperation partners of ours.

As a kick-off event, we hosted a joint webinar last Thursday on the topic of "Insights & finance tools for freelancers" with Torben Rabe, Qonto's Country Manager for Germany. It was mainly about the development of the startup and freelancer markets, new work, and the resulting changes caused by COVID. Besides helpful tips about saving money & improving your time management, all questions of the participants could be answered in the Q/A part. If you missed the event, you can rewatch it at any time on [our Crowdcast page](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/uplinkqontofinancetools).
