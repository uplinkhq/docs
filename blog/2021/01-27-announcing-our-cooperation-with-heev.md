Time and again we observe lively discussions in our Slack about the best freelancing tools. The range of tools for accounting, invoicing, or tracking your expenses and time is constantly growing. Many services try to cover the whole range of possibilities. The solutions can often be used by solo entrepreneurs, start-ups and also corporate organisations. However, the issue here is that those tools quickly become overloaded, like huge management tools.

The guys from [Heev](https://heev.me/) started working on an alternative solution, as they could not find any tool that really worked for them.

## What is the vision of Heev?

> We started working on Heev 3 years ago because we couldn't find a satisfactory solution as freelancers. Our idea was a lean, elegant, intuitive, modern software that facilitates our everyday life as freelancers. Smart, intuitive and reduced to the absolute essentials! Most tools seem dusty, overloaded and more like huge control tools than a lean facilitator.

Currently, the service is only available in German. Translations are already in progress and Heev will soon be available in English as well. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact [Justin and his team](mailto:hej@heev.me) directly! ðŸ’ª

**Of course we also negotiated a great deal for our members: Uplinklings receive a 30 % discount on all offers for the first three month. Check out the [cooperations section in the member area](https://my.uplink.tech/services/cooperations) for details.**
