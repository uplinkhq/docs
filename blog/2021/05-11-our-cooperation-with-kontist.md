For a long time, we've been fans of FinTech startup Kontist's business account, which is specifically tailored to the needs of freelancers and includes many useful features such as accounting and invoicing integrations.

## Brand new comprehensive tax service tool for freelancers ü•≥

Kontist has now launched its new [tax service for freelancers and small businesses](https://kontist.com/landing/steuerservice-uplink/) for a fixed monthly price. It allows you to calculate your tax expenses much better and don't have to wait for surprising invoices from your tax consultant anymore. The tax service is not a tool- it's a real tax consulting service provided by experts of Kontist Steuerberatung who will take care of all your tax and accounting issues. You don't need a separate financial accounting or invoicing tool. If necessary, you simply contact the folks from Kontist Steuerberatung via the app. There's no need to panic before the deadline of your tax declaration - Kontist Steuerberatung takes care of the ‚ÄúEinnahmen-√úberschuss-Rechnung‚Äù (E√úR) and the corresponding attachments in advance, which are decisive for calculating your actual tax expenses. If your earnings change, your tax prepayments are automatically adjusted. Monthly calculable fees and the reduction of your administrative work concerning tax issues allow you to focus on your key tasks as a freelancer.

You can get a great overview of the features and the provided scope of the tax service by watching the [recorded webinar with Melchior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd9abuSQDzg) from Kontist Steuerberatung, with whom we also organized a joint webinar last year about [how to optimize your hourly rate](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/webinaroptimizehourlyrate).

**We are happy to announce that we were able to negotiate again a great deal for our freelancers. Uplinklings get a 20% discount on the tax service for the first six months. If you're still not sure if the tax service is the right option for you, find out in a free initial consultation with the lovely folks at Kontist Steuerberatung.
