We are very happy to announce our new cooperation with [likvi](https://likvi.de/), an all-in-one tool for freelancers to make accounting easier and faster while also protecting the climate.

likvi - a young team from Karlsruhe with a passion for web applications - created a software for freelancers and small businesses for invoicing, time tracking, and contact management. With likvi you can digitally create and manage invoices and proposals, record your working time and manage your business contacts. Furthermore, likvi supports climate protection projects around the worldâ€”for example, many reforestation projects or the expansion of renewable energy in developing countries. ðŸŒ±

As a kick-off event, we hosted a joint webinar last week titled â€žHow to work successfully with international customersâ€œ with [Tobias Dietrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-dierich/) & [Robin Schreiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-schreiner-61aa39bb/), the founders of likvi. The webinar was mainly about the invoicing process in countries outside of the EU. It started off with the topic of liability risks and insurances, international law and contracts, payment modalities and finished with some insights about international accounting. In addition to the process of reverse-charge abroad, all questions were answered in the Q&A part. If you missed the event, you can rewatch it at any time on our [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/uplink) page.

And of course, we've been able to negotiate a great deal for our members: Uplinklings receive the first 6 months of their likvi subscription for free! Check out the [cooperations section in the member area](https://my.uplink.tech/services/cooperations) for details.
