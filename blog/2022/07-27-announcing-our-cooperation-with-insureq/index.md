_Update from November 2022 - insureQ has discontinued its operations._

We are very happy to announce our brand new cooperation with [insureQ](https://www.insureq.de/), a insurance service for your freelance business that wants to revolutionize the insurance market with their digital approach.

The Munich-based InsureTech offers customized insurance solutions for self-employed entrepreneurs and small business owners. They focus on providing a digital solution that is both transparent and easy to understand for their customers. The vision of insureQ is to simplify commercial insurance for SMEs, startups, and self-employed people while adapting it to specific industries and professional requirements. ðŸš€

To kick off our partnership, we hosted a joint webinar with [Dominik Herrmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-herrmann-756986196) on "Navigation im Versicherungsdschungel", which was held in German.

Some highlights of the webinar were:

- Essential and optional insurances for freelancers
- Typical risks for freelancers
- Common cases of damage
- Differentiation of a cyber insurance
- Pros and cons of statutory/private health insurance

Particularly useful was the differentiation of possible insurances for freelancers and small businesses, the explanation of the average cost of insurance, as well as the illustration of the criteria for choosing the best insurance broker. If you would like to get a free consultation regarding the coverage of possible risks, you can book an appointment with Dominik directly [here](https://calendly.com/dominik-gries/30min).
