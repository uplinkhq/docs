We've been working with [Qonto](https://qonto.com/de) for quite a while now and are very excited about our first successful Deep Dive about product-market fit in our joint event series "How to scale up your business". Last Tuesday Nick from our team talked with [Torben Rabe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torben-rabe/%20), who is leading the growth story for Qonto in Germany as Country Director, and [Sebastian Frederik Jacobsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hejsfj/), the CEO & Co-Founder of [Mateo](https://www.hellomateo.de/%20), about how to get from an idea to a business that works. Mateo offers an innovative tool to improve client communication.

Some highlights of the webinar were:

- Essentials when you start building your product-market fit and the implied peculiarities for a growth company
- Key components of a successful product-market fit strategy
- Importance of evaluating customer feedback effectively
- Testing strategies for product-market fit
- Personal best and worst practices of the experts

The sharing of insights about the early stages of a product launch and the personal journey of Torben and Sebastian were particularly thrilling. As the speakers shared very personal insights with the participants during the Q/A part, the webinar is not open for viewing without restrictions. If you would like to watch it afterwards, just contact us and we will share the password with you. **ðŸ¤«**

**In the next Deep Dive we will talk with members from our community and a speaker from Qonto about "How to successfully build a sales unit" on July 14 at 6:30 pm. You can already register for the event on our page on** [**Crowdcast**](https://www.crowdcast.io/uplink) **!**
