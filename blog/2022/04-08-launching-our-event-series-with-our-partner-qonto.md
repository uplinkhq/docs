We have already organized several successful webinars with our partner [Qonto](https://qonto.com/) in the past. Qonto offers a bank account tailored to the needs of freelancers, combined with smart tools that make your accounting and tax filing work much more convenient.

Recently, we talked with Torben Rabe, Qonto's Country Director Germany, about topics such as finance tools and market trends. In our last webinar, Torben shared insights on best practices on how to go from MVP to Unicorn.

All our joint events are always very interactive and include a Q/A part at the end where everyone is encouraged to ask questions!

**We had so much fun with the events and the feedback from the community was overwhelmingly positive, so we decided to launch a long-term event series with Qonto on the topic "How to scale up your business". ðŸ™Œ**  
  
For the upcoming period, we will organize quarterly Deep Dives with members from our community and speakers from Qonto's various business units, covering a wide range of topics related to successfully scaling up a business. You can look forward to the following topics:

- How to build a successful sales unit
- Recruiting strategies to successfully grow your team
- How to maintain the company culture when expanding to new countries
- Marketing strategies for international growth
- How to maintain the team spirit as a remote company

Our first Deep Dive on "How to get from an idea to a business that works" will take place on May 10, 2022. All further information will follow in the next few weeks.!
