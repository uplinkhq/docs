**We are very excited to announce our brand new cooperation with[Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.de/geschaeftskunden/versicherungen-fuer-uplink/), an insurance company that offers multiple tailored insurance cover specifically for freelancers, agencies, and companies.** A special deal for Uplinklings will be available from mid-2022. We'll keep you posted! ðŸ¤ž

This cooperation came about after we noticed regular discussions in our community about insurance topics, including the significance of liability and other risks for small agencies. We are very happy to have a second insurance provider as cooperation partner on board, whose USPs include a modular approach that allows you to precisely cover your individual risks, as well as a very high level of customer satisfaction pertaining to claims services â€“ illustrated by the latest study, which recorded satisfaction at 99%!

A joint webinar with Hiscox and other events are planned. As a kick-off for our cooperation, you'll find a guest article by Hiscox (in German) about two core types of IT insurance and associated risks [here](https://uplink.tech/blog/versicherungsmythos-sind-it-und-cyber-risiken-das-gleiche/). ðŸš€
