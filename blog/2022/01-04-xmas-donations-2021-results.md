Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
We hope you had a wonderful Christmas period and found some time to recharge "between the years".

**Today I'd like to give you the results of our [Xmas Donations campaign](https://uplink.tech/blog/xmas-donations-2021/).**

I'm happy to report that 78 of our members took part and distributed their virtual 5â‚¬ among the four organizations we picked:

- 28 members assigned 1,59â‚¬ on average to [Queer Lexikon e.V.](https://queer-lexikon.net/) for a total of 44,50â‚¬.
- 33 members assigned 1,83â‚¬ on average to [A Bowl of Compassion e.V.](https://bowlofcompassion.org/) for a total of 60,50â‚¬.
- 47 members assigned 2,69â‚¬ on average to [FragDenStaat](https://fragdenstaat.de/) for a total of 126,50â‚¬.
- 53 members assigned 2,99â‚¬ on average to [Traglinge e.V.](https://www.traglinge-ev.de/) for a total of 158,50â‚¬.

Thanks to everyone who participated!
We have decided to double each donation and will transfer the sums within the next days.
