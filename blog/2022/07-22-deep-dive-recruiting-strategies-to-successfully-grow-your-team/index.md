Last week we hosted already the second "Deep Dive" webinar about recruiting strategies in our joint long-term event series "How to scale up your business" with our partner [Qonto](https://qonto.com/de). Nick from the Uplink team talked to [Torben Rabe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torben-rabe/), who is leading the growth story for Qonto in Germany as Country Director, and [Sebastian Britz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-britz-336907138/), the CEO & Co-Founder of [DIGITTY](https://digitty.io/), whose AI solution for project management reduces the complexity and unpredictability of digital projects.

Some highlights of the webinar were:

- Discussion about the recruiting trends in the last years
- Elements of successful recruiting strategies
- Impact of social media for employer branding
- Talent acquisition channels
- Significance of referral systems
- Relevance of freelancers
- Talent assessment

It was very inspiring to analyze the different hiring practices and challenges from the perspective of a startup as well as from the experience of a successful grown-up. Most insightful was in particular the analysis of opportunities that arise from increased remote work and the resulting internationalization that is becoming even more prevalent.

**We are already looking forward to the next Deep Dive, which will probably happen at the beginning of October after a short summer break. The whole event was recorded and you can rewatch the webinar at any time on [our Crowdcast page](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/recruitingstrategies).**
