We are more than happy to announce our new cooperation with [Movers and Makers](https://www.moversmakers.eu/), who offer a comprehensive set of tools and resources for freelancers providing digital and creative services. Their approach helps freelancers and small agencies to step out of the "time for money" circle and support them to implement value-based services for their businesses. Clients accomplish this through individual consulting, training and workshops about the possibilities of hybrid models of standardized offers.

To kick off our partnership, we talked to the founder Max Antosch in our podcast about how freelancers can manage to sell their work based on value and increase their revenue. üöÄ

Some highlights of the episode were:

- How to stand out from the crowd?
- Importance and steps of specialization/becoming an expert for self-positioning
- How can I make the best use of my time?
- How can I define services that I can offer to my client?
- Retention of clients after the implementation of a service to ensure trust and long-term business relationships
- ‚ÄúKnow, Like, Trust‚Äù as a marketing concept

Particularly interesting were the insights on how to make the best use of one's time and how this can define a service. First of all, you have to be aware of what suits you best, what you enjoy doing and with what kind of clients you would most like to work with. Then you have to analyze the potential challenges of the clients and highlight how you have already supported similar clients in the past. Create a playbook - with which methods and processes can you support best? In the final step, you can develop the packages that you can offer.
