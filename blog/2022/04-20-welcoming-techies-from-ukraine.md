Usually, we only accept folks who are already registered as a freelancer (or running their own company) to our community. **For the foreseeable future, though, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the situation of refugees arriving in Germany, we will gladly welcome any Ukrainian citizen working in IT/tech to Uplink!**

We are a big, friendly community of over 2.300 Germany-based IT freelancers, and we'd like to offer our support to all Ukrainians looking to register as a freelancer, found a company, or find a permanent IT job in Germany!

Unfortunately, the German bureaucracy still lives up to its image of being unnecessarily complicated, frustratingly slow, and - mostly - offline. So before venturing out and facing the Finanzamt on your own, ask a few people who have done what you want to do!

Also, we'd like to recommend Expath, who offer [free beginner German courses](https://www.expath.com/for-individuals/german-for-refugees) to Ukrainian nationals and other residents of Ukraine displaced by the war.
