Last month, we hosted our second annual Freelance Summer Fest, a joint effort with our favorite competitors CodeControl and 9am! üòÑ

More than 200 people signed up and despite some rain, we were a huge crowd and had a great time until late into the night! üçª
It was really fantastic to meet so many of you that we previously only knew from our Community Slack, and meet new people who were not part of our community yet (but hopefully joined asap after the event üòâ). Events like the Summer Fest give us the energy to keep working on Uplink, even though the economic conditions are less than ideal right now.

Thanks to everyone who joined us and thank you all for making Uplink such a special place. üß°
