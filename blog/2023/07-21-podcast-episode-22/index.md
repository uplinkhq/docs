On today's episode, I talk to Tia Robinson, co-founder and CEO of Expath. Expath supports startups and tech companies with global mobility, relocation and language training services. With their assistance, thousands of skilled workers have been able to relocate to Germany.

We talked about the main challenges and benefits for companies offering relocation assistance, as well as the reasons why remote work is not always the better option. Tia shares compelling insights about the financial and time-sensitive aspects of relocation processes, along with several best practices if you are considering relocation for a job as well.
