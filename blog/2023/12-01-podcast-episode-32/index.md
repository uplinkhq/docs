In today's episode, we chat with Jon Younger, who has been at the forefront of Open Talent platforms and the Freelance Revolution from the very beginning—or as he puts it, "since the beginning of time." A regular contributor to Forbes magazine, Jon also collaborates with Matt Mottola on the "Human Cloud."

We delve into Jon's experiences with freelance platforms, explore the challenges faced by smaller platforms compared to their larger counterparts, discuss how to maintain the essence of a close-knit community as a platform expands, and get a glimpse of his predictions for the future of the freelance market.
