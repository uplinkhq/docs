Dealing with taxes is an unavoidable part of being self-employed. Especially in Germany, where bureaucracy and tax laws are notoriously complicated, it's important to have a knowledgeable expert at your side—either to do all the sorting and filing for you or at least to consult with when important questions come up.

Today we want to announce our partnership with the tax consultancy [Führer & Orgel](http://fo-steuerberater.de/), who we have been working with for over 10 years (so even before Uplink was born about 2.5 years ago). They have been a reliable partner and helped us—and many freelancers and small companies that we referred to them—with all tax-related issues we have encountered over the years.

To start our cooperation, we will...

- start to recommend Führer & Orgel "officially" to all freelancers in our network when we get asked for a reliable tax accountant, and
- organize an "Expert Session" with Mr. Orgel and 10-15 members of our network where he will give a short talk on common mistakes that he has seen freelancers make when preparing taxes on their own; afterwards there will be a chance for our members to discuss tax-related questions with him.

Additionally, we have a few ideas for further projects and services that can be developed together with Führer & Orgel. Stay tuned!
