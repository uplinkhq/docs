In beginning of June, the Uplink community in Berlin got together once again to discuss the important things in life over a few cold beers. The location this time was the lovely "Tiergartenquelle" in – you guessed it – the Tiergarten district.

Below are a few photos from the evening. If you are an IT freelancer in Berlin, Hamburg, München or anywhere else in Germany and would like to connect with your fellow freelancers, [join us](https://uplink.tech/freelancer/#apply)!
