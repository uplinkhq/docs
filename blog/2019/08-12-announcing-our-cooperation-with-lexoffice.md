The most tedious part of being self-employed are often the accounting dutiesâ€“whether it's the monthly or quarterly preliminary tax returns, the full tax return at the end of the fiscal year, or simply matching incoming payments to outgoing invoices. If you are not yet using a capable software for your invoicing and accounting, you are probably spending too much time on it!
