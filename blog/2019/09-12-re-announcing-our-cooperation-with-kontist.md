**_Update from August 2020 - we reactivated our cooperation with Kontist. Find out the new conditions in our recent Blogpost._**

The Berlin-based FinTech startup Kontist [was our first cooperation partner](https://medium.com/uplink-it-freelancer-network/announcing-uplinks-first-partner-kontist-2484d587528e) and we are still big fans of their business bank account designed for freelancers! Nowadays they're offering even more and help you to stay on top of your business with real-time tax calculation, accounting integrations, and much more.

This is why we're renewing our cooperation by offering Uplink members an even sweeter deal than before: [**starting today, Uplink members get the Kontist premium business bank account for free for 12 months!**](https://kontist.com/offers/uplink?shortlink=uplink&pid=Marketing%20Partnership&af_channel=uplink&af_site_id=uplink100&campaign=lexoffice100)

Moreover, if you act quickly and open your Kontist account within the next 7 days (until September 19), you will receive a 50â‚¬ starting bonus! So if you have been on the lookout for a bank that is fully dedicated to support you and your freelancing business, this is your chance - it only takes 11 minutes to create your Kontist account!
