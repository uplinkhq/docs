:::info Update from May 2023

We had to raise the price from 200€ to 300€ to be able to continue to offer this service.
The rest of this blog post will reference the old price.

Some of the most common questions we have seen over the years in our Slack workspace had to do with recruiter contracts and how hard it is for a freelancer to know whether they are fair or not.

**A typical recruiter contract has 12-15 pages (often separated into a framework contract and a project agreement) and is not easy to understand by someone who doesn't see these kinds of documents every day.**

What can you do when faced with such a contract? You could google certain clauses that sound fishy or ask other freelancers in a community like Uplink, but you can't be sure that the answers you receive are substantiated. Alternatively, you could try to find a lawyer specialized in these kinds of contracts, but it takes time to do so and you might end up spending several hundreds of Euros and not receive a satisfactory assessment either.

**So we decided to team up with an experienced lawyer and offer the "contract check" as a service!** For a flat fee of 200€ (+ VAT) our lawyer will review your contract and point out common pitfalls, exaggerated fees, and everything else you should be aware of.

## How it works

We tried to keep the process as simple as possible:

1. You upload the recruiter contract [in our member area](https://my.uplink.tech/services/contract_checks) and answer a form with a few basic questions.
2. Our lawyer will do a quick review of the contract and your answers. If everything looks good, he will start checking your contract immediately. If he has follow-up questions, he will contact you via email or Slack.
3. You will receive the annotated contract and our invoice (200€ + VAT) within 3 working days.
4. If anything is unclear, you are welcome to contact our lawyer and he will explain his annotations. Please note though that extensive follow-up questions or suggestions for alternative phrasings are not included in the flat fee.

## Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back!

We want you to be 100% happy with our service, so if you're not satisfied with the end result, you won't have to pay the fee.

## First five for free

To celebrate the launch of this service, we are offering the first five contract checks to our members for free!

The first one was already done a few days ago and this is the freelancer's feedback:

> Durch die klarstellenden Hinweise kann ich nun die Bedeutung und Konsequenzen der Vertragsklauseln verstehen. Ich konnte kurzfristig eine Änderung im konkreten Projektvertrag zu meinen Gunsten erreichen. Für eine etwaige Projektverlängerung werde ich frühzeitig die Formulierungsanpassung essentieller Punkte anstreben. Dank der Formulierungsvorschläge kann ich dann auch einen konkret angepassten Vertrag als Forderung vorlegen.

We're looking forward to receiving more feedback like this as we help more freelancers dealing with recruiter contracts!
