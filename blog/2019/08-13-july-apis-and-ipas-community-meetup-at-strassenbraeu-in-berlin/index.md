On July 25, a good chunk of the Berlin Uplink community got together again to enjoy each other's company while sipping on a good cold beer! We returned to [Straßenbräu](http://www.strassenbraeu.de), a fantastic brewery and bar near Ostkreuz, where a previous meetup in 2018 already took place.

If you're not yet a member of Uplink but would like to join the local IT freelancer community in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich or any other city in Germany, [sign up](https://uplink.tech/freelancer/#apply)!
